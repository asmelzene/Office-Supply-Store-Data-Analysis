# Office-Supply-Store-Data-Analysis

Project is done on 30.Nov.2019 as a Capstone Project of 'https://emeritus.org/online-diploma-programs/postgraduate-diploma-in-applied-data-science/'

Background:

An office supply store tests a telemarketing campaign to its existing business customers. The company targeted approximately 16,000 customers for the campaign. 
Assume you are a consultant brought on board to help the company leverage and use the findings from the tests to its advantage. Refer to the accompanying 
spreadsheet, which contain the results of the tests. 

Project objectives:
Profile the customers that responded to the campaign to make the company aware of who its typical customer is.
Develop models that will allow the company to use the results of the campaign to target future, similar campaigns.
Show the financial value of your models.
Expected deliverables:
A deck that details your findings and the models (must include a clear gains chart showing the financial contribution of your results) and the percent of the base
that can be profitably targeted for the next campaign.

Relevant financials:
Gross margin on sales: 22%
Campaign cost: $45.65 per business contacted
Transaction cost: $8.40 per transaction
Data sheets:

Methodology:
Create model and validation sets
Develop a model to estimate the probability of responding to this campaign
Develop a model to estimate the size ($) of the transaction
Calculate the expected profit resulting from each target; use the formula below:
E(Profit)=.22*Prob(Sale)*Est(Transaction Size)-$8.40*Prob(Sale)-$45.65
Illustrate the contribution to profitability associated with your models versus random targeting
Create a presentation for your client
